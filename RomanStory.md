Opiter Armenias Iustus, the paterfamilias of the Iustus gens was facing a dilemma. His wife, for whom he held a deep affection, Hosta, had been suffering from an ailment that showed no sign of quelling. She had been a kind and devoted wife and mother who had sired three beautiful daughters for him. Seeing her suffer like this had been taking more of a toll on Opiter than he'd like to admit.

"Father, mother's condition has been getting worse. Perhaps, we should send for a doctor."

Although usually timid, Opiter's eldest Octavia was the first to speak up in this situation. She had justly inherited her mother's voice of reason.

"Shush, little girl. This is a matter for the adults. And to suggest calling in those greek heretics. Having anyone other than the paterfamilias treat the sick, is to challenge his authority. We should instead increase the dosage of the cabbage soup."

Opiter's aunt Lucia had been living under his care ever since her husband's demise. Although she is quite knowledgeable and witty, she is obsessed with upholding the ancient Roman way.

What should Opiter do?

A. Rebuke Octavia and side with lucia.

B. Pacify Lucia and bring in the doctor.

C. Appear to side with Lucia but bring in the doctor secretly.
